# Farmers-Markets

This website will allow a user to type in their address to find the nearest farmers markets, sorted based on distance to the user.

View the website [here](https://pshin15.github.io/Farmers-Markets/).

I used the list of Farmers markets in Prince George's County API: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/sphi-rwax.json.
What visualisations does your project drive?
This project uses the Leaflet Javascript library.
Custom CSS styles are incorporated into the site.
My actual project is trying to display a list of nearby farmer's markets as well as show them on a map.
